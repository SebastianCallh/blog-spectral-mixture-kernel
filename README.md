# Forecasting with Spectral Mixture kernels
This is a companion repo for [my blog post](https://sebastiancallh.github.io/post/spectral-mixture-kernels/) which takes a look at the Spectral Mixture kernel as presented in [Gaussian Process Kernels for Pattern Discovery and Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4245).

## How to run
Make sure you run in a virtual environment, then `pip install -r requirements.txt` and you should be good to go. 
To fit the models and produce plots run the scripts in the [scripts](scripts) folder and provide the command line arguments you like.
